## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I create this application to put in practice my html, css and JS skills. With this app you will be able to schedule tasks that you have to complete through your day and to know when you had completed a task.

## Lessons Learned:

Learn about localStorage so the tasks still shown although the page is refresh 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
